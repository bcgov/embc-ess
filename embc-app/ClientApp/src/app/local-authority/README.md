# Local Authority
This folder is used for components and pages available to a local authority. The local authority is a "volunteer" with some administrative capabilities within their organization. The prime difference between the two is that the local authority can add and remove volunteers within their organization. This "team management" is distinctly different from the type of management done by a provincial admin which has the privilege to administer organizations and users within them.
