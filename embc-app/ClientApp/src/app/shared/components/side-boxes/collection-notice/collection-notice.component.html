      The role of the Emergency Support Services volunteer is to ensure the evacuee understands the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Information is being collected on behalf of Emergency Management BC for the purpose of providing emergency services
      </li>
      <li>
        The information is collected under the authority of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FoIPPA)
      </li>
      <li>
        By submitting your email address, you authorize Emergency Management BC to communicate with you by email about your registration and to invite you to provide feedback about your experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
