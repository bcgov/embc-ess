      <li>
        The user is responsible for all actions performed by their “BCeID" except for fraudulent use of the “BCeID” by
        an unauthorized third party.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user is required to adhere to all policies, standards or procedures pertaining to data security, naming
        conventions and good data processing practices, issued by EMBC.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user should be aware that it is possible that security can be breached through causes beyond the reasonable
        control of EMBC and the community. Users are urged to take full advantage of security mechanisms built into the
        systems and to change their password frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user recognizes that to monitor security, the Ministry of Attorney General, Information Services Branch may be
        required to examine access by clients or users without prior notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user acknowledges that all data stored on the system are government records which can be accessed by
        Ministry officials in accordance with established policies and form a “record” under the
        Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (see General Management Operating Policy Chapter 3.5.13 and BC
        Archives and Record Services, Records Information Management manual Policy No. 5.13/01).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Privacy:</strong></p>
    <ol start="7">
      <li>
        The user understands that personal information means recorded information about an identifiable individual other
        than business contact information. The identifiable individual may be an EMBC employee, a volunteer, or an
        evacuee. If the personal information is de-identified using an indirect identifier such as case and file number
        or username, the information is still considered personal information. Indirect Identifiers may identify an
        individual when they are connected with other pieces of information to single out an individual (e.g. age,
        gender, date of visit). While indirect identifiers on their own may not be personal information, they are
        considered personal information if they can be combined together to identify an individual. This is commonly
        referred to as the mosaic effect - when the combinations of data elements that in isolation look relatively
        innocuous, can amount to personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user is collecting personal information from an evacuee, the user must at the time of collection,
        <ul>
          <li>
            inform the individual of the purposes for collecting personal information;
          </li>
          <li>
            limit the amount and type of personal information collected to what is necessary to fulfill the purpose;
          </li>
          <li>
            make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information collected is accurate and complete; and
          </li>
          <li>
            must only use or disclose the personal information for the purpose identified when it was collected.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The user must safeguard personal information from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
        modification or disposal by individuals from within and outside your organization.
      </li>
    </ol>
