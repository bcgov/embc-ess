        <strong>Trouble locating an evacuee file?</strong>
        <br />
        If the evacuee doesn't have an ESS File # and you entered the evacuees' details,
        ensure all details entered were correct (this includes spelling and/or special characters)
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, contact your ESS Supervisor for assisstance.

        In the event that there is more than one listing for an evacuee with the same date of birth and address,
        select the file with the most recent “Self-Registration Date & Time” or “Registration Date & Time.”
