# Provincial Admin
This folder is used for components and pages available to a provincial administrator. The provincial admin user accesses the system with their IDIR instead of a BCeID. They are allowed to make changes to organizations and volunteers. They also have the evacuee registration capabilities afforded to a standard volunteer in the case that they are working in an evacuation centre.
